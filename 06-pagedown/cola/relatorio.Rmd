# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, c(1:4)]), caption = 'An example table.')
```


# Including Plots {#plots}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Exemplo de figura"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot \@ref(plots).

Referência à seção [R Markdown].

```{r, child="parte-2.Rmd"}

```
